There are a couple ways to add a service to the mesh. What's meant by "adding the service to the mesh" is we install the Envoy proxy alongside the workload. We can do a manual injection of the sidecar or automatically do it. Let's start to deploy some workloads.

Now let's label this namespace with the appropriate labels to enable sidecar injection:

```bash
kubectl label namespace istioinaction istio.io/rev=1-8-3
```

Now that we have our service up and running, we should be able to call it:

```bash
kubectl exec -it deploy/sleep -- curl http://web-api.istioinaction:8080/
```

```
{
  "name": "web-api",
  "uri": "/",
  "type": "HTTP",
  "ip_addresses": [
    "10.40.9.22"
  ],
  "start_time": "2021-02-12T13:11:44.868851",
  "end_time": "2021-02-12T13:11:44.972806",
  "duration": "103.95516ms",
  "body": "Hello From Web API",
  "upstream_calls": [
    {
      "name": "recommendation",
      "uri": "http://recommendation:8080",
      "type": "HTTP",
      "ip_addresses": [
        "10.40.9.23"
      ],
      "start_time": "2021-02-12T13:11:44.879324",

      "body": "Hello From Recommendations!",

        {

    }
  ],

}
```

## Digging into Proxy configuration

Coming back to our services in the `istioinaction` namespace, let's take a look at some of the Envoy configuration for the sidecar proxies.

```bash
kubectl get po -n istioinaction
```

```
NAME                                  READY   STATUS    RESTARTS   AGE
purchase-history-v1-b8dc86db6-wfpvm   2/2     Running   0          28m
recommendation-58c475d67b-f6k8s       2/2     Running   0          28m
web-api-7b79c4d9c8-7l2l7              2/2     Running   0          72s
```

We will use the `istioctl proxy-config` command to inspect the configuration of the `web-api` pod's proxy. For example, to see the listeners configured on the proxy run something like this:

```bash
istioctl proxy-config listener web-api-7b79c4d9c8-7l2l7.istioinaction
```

Note the name of the pod and namespaces here might be different for your system.

We can also see the clusters that have been configured:

```bash
istioctl proxy-config clusters web-api-7b79c4d9c8-7l2l7.istioinaction
```

If we want to see more information about how the cluster for `recommendation.istioinaction` has been configured by Istio, run this command:

```bash
istioctl proxy-config clusters web-api-7b79c4d9c8-7l2l7.istioinaction --fqdn recommendation.istioinaction.svc.cluster.local -o json
```

```
[
    
        "name": "outbound|8080||recommendation.istioinaction.svc.cluster.local",
        "type": "EDS",
        "edsClusterConfig": {
            "edsConfig": {
                "ads": {},
                "resourceApiVersion": "V3"
            },
            "serviceName": "outbound|8080||recommendation.istioinaction.svc.cluster.local"
        },
        "connectTimeout": "10s",
        "circuitBreakers": {
            "thresholds": [
                {
                    "maxConnections": 4294967295,
                    "maxPendingRequests": 4294967295,
                    "maxRequests": 4294967295,
                    "maxRetries": 4294967295
                }
            ]
        },
    }
]

```

Note this is just a snippet, there are other configurations there specific to Istio and TLS connectivity. But if you recall the cluster configurations from the previous lab, you'll see they are similar. Istiod took information about the environment, user configurations, and service discovery, and translated this to an appropriate configuration _for this specific workload_
